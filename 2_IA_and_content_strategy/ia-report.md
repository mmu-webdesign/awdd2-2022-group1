## Card sort

### Introduction


As a group we had a discussion around the basis of what we wanted to feature on our website. Initially we decided on the specific type of content to include on our website. Next, we collectively came up with 20 Generic examples of the possible content on the Fallowfield Fashion website.

We then used the Card Sort feature on the Optimal Workshop website to turn the 20 examples into card elements. Using the Card Sort feature we created an open card sort with the 20 card elements, sent the study to 5 different and random participants, who then, in turn, created their own categorise to group the card elements into.  

As the purpose of this exercise is to find the best categorises to group our content, so the website is easy to navigate and user friendly. The results collected from the study, were displayed in the results section of the study-homepage. As a group we condensed the different categorises from each study down to just one for each element, based on the similarity of each participants answers.

### Cart sort results


The results collected from the study, were displayed in the results section of the study-homepage. The result was the categorises the 5 participants decide to group the 20 card elements under. 

Through the results of the study, we saw a consistent pattern in the categorisation of the card elements. For example, we had 4 card elements based on the time of year, Spring, Summer etc… All the participants named the category holding these 4 card elements a variation of the word seasons. 

Based on the similarity of each proposed category, we condensed each elements assigned category down to 1 agreed name.

## Tree testing

### Introduction



Following the open card sort study, we used both the card the elements and the consolidated categorises to create a draft of the website’s architecture. 
We used the 5 consolidated Categories from the study results, to be the main headings beneath the homepage in the site architecture. The end destinations were based on the 20 card elements we collectively thought of. 

We then used the Tree Testing feature on the Optimal Workshop website to create a study based on the site architecture. The study requires participants to navigate through the site architecture and decide where they think they would find a specific element of the website. During setting up the study, we as a group, decided on 5 elements of the website for the participants to find using the site architecture. 

As the purpose of this exercise is to discover if the current site architecture is user friendly and easy to navigate. The results of the study are based on whether the participants were able to locate where the specified element is stored and if they couldn’t locate the element, we ask for feedback as to why.

### Tree testing results


Three participants have taken part in the study, all three participants were able to locate the 5 elements. Therefore, we draw the conclusion that the current architecture is easy to navigate and user friendly. 

However, one participant gave the feedback that for some of the elements, although it was clear where they were located, it had taken 3 or 4 clicks. This from a user-friendly point of view, isn’t good. As we want the users to have as fewer clicks as possible.
