# Usability Test Script

# Welcome

Hello! I'm Leon, these are my teammates Jack, Sam, and Sam, no not that one, the other one.

## Context

We're building a site that introduces new students to the fashion scene, particularly in Fallowfield, where most students live in Manchester.

## Why you are doing the testing

As you are a student/apprentice, we'd like to see how you feel about the site, and what kind of things you think could be improved or any issues - anything you think would stop a student from using it!
## Not testing you

We're gonna give you some tasks to complete, but just remember if you struggle with anythig, it's our fault and not yours! We're testing the system, not you.

## Do I have to do this?

And obviously you can decide you don't want to do it anymore, if you want to quit at any time just let us know, no problem.

## Advantages

You're doing us a big favour doing this, so just to thank you before we start for helping us out!

## Data

Just to check off some data stuff, we're gonna record the session so we can have a look back if we need it, but it's not going to be used for anything else and it's going to be held in my MMU drive as it's my call, I'll delete them once everything is submitted and we're finished. Got it?

## Think aloud

Cool, so we're gonna give you a few things to do on this prototype you should be able to see, if you take control of my screen you should be able to play around with what we've got. As you're doing the tasks it would be great if you could sort of narrate yourself, we'd like to hear what you're thinking with every action you take. For example why you're clicking a particular button, where you think it might take you, things like that. Great! Let's crack on.

## Tasks

Okay so this is the landing page of the site. Can you quickly tell me your initial thoughts, what you think the site is about, purely from this screen?
1- the first thing we want to do is to sign ourselves up for the site's mailing list. Can you show me how you think you might do that?
2 - okay, next we want to see what kind of things we can get up to in Manchester each week. Can you tell me what event I can find on a Wednesday?
3 - Stay on this page for the moment, how would you get back to the homepage if you needed to?
4 - cool, so it's coming up to Summer, can you show me how you'd find out what sort of things are trending in terms of summer wear at the moment?
5 - How about in the winter?
6 - perfect. So let's say you wanted to follow us on instagram if we had one, show me how you might do that.

## Spare Tasks

Great. Let's say you have an issue with the site, or you want to suggest something. Let's see how you'd let us know!
Finally, we want to check up the latest news currently available in the world of fashion. How would we do that?

## Thank you

Perfect! That's all the time we have, thank you so much for helping us out today! We really appreciate it.

## Exit Survey

There is one final thing we need from you if we could! If you could fill out this form I've pasted into the chat, just about the site and what you thought, it's so we can have some ideas of what to improve et cetera and it's a lot easier to look back on if we have them written down! Perfect! Thanks again for your time, see you again some time!
