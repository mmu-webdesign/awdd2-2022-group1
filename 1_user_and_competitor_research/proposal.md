We want to convey what is Fallowfield fashion which contains where and what is Fallowfield, how this fashion is unique and what this showcase. Our guide is unique as we are the only guide to showcase specifically fashion of Fallowfield and student fashion in Manchester exclusively our target audience is students however, at the beginning our audience will be students and the media to showcase our website.  

We will communicate via text with short descriptions of each item and where to buy this with a link following common design of our competitor at Pinterest or common fashion websites as this can showcase the fit of the item or when to wear the item. Furthermore, we will use images to demonstrate clothing etc. Icons will be used to show familiar items such as home etc. as these are easy to identify what it is for and can be made accessible. The text will be brief but demonstrating the Fallowfield style in language and the colours used will be sleek and basic letting the images doing the communicating of ideas. Each page should have one purpose and be easily identifiable this leads to ease of use and easily accessibility.
