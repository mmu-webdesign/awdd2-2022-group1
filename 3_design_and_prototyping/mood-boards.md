Jack Forster 
I liked the colours fitting together the black and white for a sleek monochrome look and then red to represent the red brick of manchester and green as I liked the shade and felt it was a good contrast on the black background. 
The images represent our brand and fallowfield itself. 
The rounded fonts were light and supposed to represent the fun brand we aim to be.

### Sam Snape
I took inspiration from other famous related fashion websites, such as Vogue, Asosâ€¦etc. I also like the the Simplistic look, using black, white and neutral colours. It allows the the content of the website to stand out, and focuses the attention of the user on the featured content.
