I liked the colours fitting together the black and white for a sleek monochrome look and then red to represent the red brick of manchester and green as I liked the shade and felt it was a good contrast on the black background. 
The images represent our brand and fallowfield itself. 
The rounded fonts were light and supposed to represent the fun brand we aim to be.
