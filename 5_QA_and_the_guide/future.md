As a team we think there are multiple ways our website can be developed in the future, providing an improved user experience. 

The first, would be building the functionality to provide users their own ‘site account’. Allowing us to provide the user with a personalised experience. Users would be able to save outfits, news articles and trends they like and easily navigate back to them at a later point in time. This additional functionality would require further development time and would venture outside of the scope given by the client.  

A second idea for development was to hire a part-time journalist, to write news articles on the latest fashion and trends, this would enrich the content the users of the site consume. However, the projects budget didn’t cover the cost for an additional team member. 

A further development opportunity is around advertising, once the site is up and running, there may be the opportunity to advertise local retailers, venues, and fashion brands around Fallowfield. Expanding on advertisement, the site could act as ‘third party marketplace’. Enabling local and small independent brands and business to not only advertise but sell their products and services through our site. This development to the site would require further investment from the client but it would also create an additional revenue stream. 

As a team we also want to know what a user’s want from the site. Once the site has been launched we will ask our users to complete a survey, asking them how they think the site could be improved.
