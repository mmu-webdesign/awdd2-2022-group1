IOS safari worked great the website seemed to scale to the screen and went more condensed to be scrollable and readable which is exactly what we wanted. 

** couldnt test fully as no user testing participant had an android.

### Name of persona

David - He likes to flick through pages looking at latest trends and news he wants a speedy resposive webpage and will lose interest if taking too long to respond or it doesnt respond to the device he is on. Univeristy and work means he accesses sites from multiple entry points either Apple Iphone when on the go or via his laptop when working for university. He uses multiple broswers having different objects on both using both chrome and Edge.  It should all be accessible to him from the UI menu and shouldnt be difficult to work out where he is going between web pages again if this happens he will lose interest and leave the page possibly even the brand. 

This persona was taken from accumulating research responses from the group of ten we researched via questionaires about their usual behaviours online, broswers and devices used and what they wanted from a website. There was a lot of common behaviours exhibited that could be linked to the new fast paced world of social media. There was of course outliers.

The most common browser was chrome with edge coming in second with most users having both installed. Apple Iphone was the most common mobile device with some reporting using Ipad and android devices also.
